## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

The **Growth Mindset** is a learning process of being something different tomorrow than what you are today. You are able to grow and expand your knowledge. If you adapt this mindset, you can begin to create awareness i.e. when you are struggling with something new and wanting to give up you can recognize it and pause and say wait, maybe I can change the way I approach this to learn this.


Tracking your *own* progress and looking back to see what you have accomplished and how far you've come. Not comparing with others, because everyone learns and grows at their own pace.   


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?


I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset with learning at Turing.  Recognizing that I'm diving in to a lot of new material and that I will struggle, but making mental (and physical) lists of what I need to do to practice and learn.  I think that recently I've had a fixed mindset about learning guitar... I think that I have it in my mind that I was not born with a natural gift of being musically talented.  But I recognize that this is not true, it just might take longer and be more of a struggle to learn that skill.


3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.


I think that developers at Facebook use many Arrays for a user's profile photos, posts, friends, groups, etc.  These are all lists of items that can be called upon, added, or deleted by their index.  


4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.


An Array method is a way to transform or alter an array of items.  You are able to add to the front or end of an array, remove from front or end or at a specific index of an array, split an array into subarrays, and more.  


5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?


The purpose of a loop is to perform an action repeatedly, a specific number of times, without having to write out each.  You write code for one item and instruct the computer to loop through the action for the other items until reaching a set number that tells the computer to end the loop.  Looping in conjunction to an array is helpful when you want to iterate the same code over the length of the array.  We could also use a loop for a string or an integer.  In an integer case, we could tell the computer to multiply our variable by 2, for example, with the variable increasing by 1 each time, repeatedly until the variable equals 10.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?


I would teach a 5 year old about loops by using an example such as:  They are dog sitting for 5 dogs and for each one they have to tell the dog to sit, say 'good-dog', and give them a treat.  And repeat that for each dog. This is a loop because they are repeating the same action for each dog.


7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?


When you pop or push an array, for example, do you need to use `var newLength = foods.pop()` or can you just use `foods.pop()` both worked for my terminal but I'm confused on the proper syntax.
