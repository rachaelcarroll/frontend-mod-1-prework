## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I felt that I actually was able to focus better in this shorter increments.  I think that while coding, it's easy to get sucked in and not realize how much time has passed.  This technique allowed me to refresh my mind a bit, especially when I was stuck on something.  

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?


I found that if I was stuck on something, the Pomodoro technique helped give my brain a little bit of a break and return to what I was working on with a fresh mind.  However, I did find that 25 minutes felt a bit short so I went to 30-35 minutes instead on most days.  I found that I was able to focus and get a lot done and that what I accomplished aligned with what I had planned out before starting the Mod 1 pre work, minus a couple times that I ran into issues and reached out to my classmates on Slack.    


3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An Object is different than an Array in that is a way to store and retrieve more complex data.  For instance, with an Array you can only access an item by it's index.  Whereas, with an Object, you are able to store different data types and even functions within the Object and access them by strings and arrays.


4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
I would use an array for this since it is a list of like items.  Students can be added or removed and accessed by their index.
  * List of states and their capitals
I would use an array for this if you are just stating the "city,state" since these can be accessed and sorted, and most likely will not need to be modified.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
I would use an array for this set of data since it a list of like items for vacation that you can access by index, remove, add to, sort, etc.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
I would use an array to store this data as they are like items and contain one set of data - names.  You could access these by index, add, and remove.
  * List of student names and their cohort
I would use an object for this set of data since you are assigning a cohort to each student.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
I would use an object for this since you are assigning values to each different ingredient in the cake.  
  * All my favorite restaurants
I would use an array for this list of restaurants. You would be able to add, remove, or sort these in an array.


5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

An example that comes to mind is the MyFitnessPal app which is essentially a food diary app.  It would have a `nutrition diary object` with keys and values such as:
 ```
    date: "02/16/20";
    caloriesConsumed: 1850;
    caloriesBurned: 2000;
    ouncesWater: 80;
    isOnTrack = true;
```
6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

No specific questions, just a little confused between an Object/Class after these exercises. Specifically, how to format the method for the tweets.js exercise.  The error that I found I was getting most often in this section was that I had not defined a variable, which I thought I had inside the Object.
