## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

If you think of question asking on a spectrum from too soon to too long, I would fall a little bit to the right of middle.  I think that I tend to want to try to figure out an answer by researching and trial and error because I tend to learn best by *doing*.  I also find that I ask more questions in person or over zoom because there is more ability to bounce questions back and forth.  But I have noticed that Slack is extremely accessible and helpful for asking a peer a question.  When I stop to recognize that other people are also hitting walls and needing to ask for help, this makes me feel safe and comfortable to do the same.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?


I loved this aspect.  I find that by searching different resources and trying to come up with a solution, it forces me to slow down and read the *why* behind what I'm doing.  I also tend to learn best by doing, so this worked well for me to pick up some of the nuances on the Functions exercise.  I also took the time to jot down the node command on each exercise so that I could easily access it to check my work in the terminal.


3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.


A conditional statement is choosing an outcome based on a decision.  For example, if it is sunny outside I will wear my sunglasses. Or you can build off of that and make multiple conditions like: If it is snowing, I will wear a raincoat, or if it's snowing, I will wear my snow boots, otherwise I will wear shorts. This can be applied to many web applications such as when it is your first time logging in to an app, the greeting could say "Welcome to Hinge, Rachael" or if has been a while since you've logged on (could set condition to > 30 days, for example), the greeting could change to "Welcome back! It's been a while, let's show you what has changed."


4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.


The computer reads multiple `if` statements by going through each one and determining if the condition is true or false, based on the variables defined for each condition.  If it is true, it executes the command.  If it is false, it could also execute a different command and/or it could go to the next `if` statement and so on.


5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?


I would say that you could use code comments and write out what each would log.  I think that this would walk you through each condition and would allow you to see if it would log true or false.  Also, you could run these in your terminal.  (I'm not sure if that would count as running the block of code or not?)


6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?


I am a little confused on defining the variable inside or outside of the function? And also deciding what to name functions and parameters. But I think this will make more sense as I run in to more examples. I also need to practice the syntax for each and get used to adding {} and ; where appropriate.
