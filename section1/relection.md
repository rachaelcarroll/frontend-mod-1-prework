## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

An error message popped up when I tried to access this article.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

I learned about a few data types including numbers, strings, and booleans.  The *number* type includes any type of number including whole numbers and decimals.  The *string* type consists of any letter or character and begins and ends with single or double quotes. Finally, a *boolean* is a data type that can be assigned a true or false value.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

I would either use ``//`` for single line comments, or ``/* */`` can be used to indicate comments for multiple lines.  Code comments are important because it allows you to go more in depth in your code reasoning. And this can be seen and communicated among other developers working on a project. They also allow you to temporarily deactivate a line of code without deleting it.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is the declaration of a thing and the value that is assigned to the thing.  So, if you are 5 years old you would say age = 5.  I would say age = 31.  These can both change as someone turns another year older, as can a variable.  Like if you say pizza is your favoriteFood, but then you change your mind, and tacos are now your favorite.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I frequently use the Calm app which probably uses variables such as: premiumUser = true (boolean)
meditation = "Deep Sleep" (string)
daysActive = 35 (integer)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation means joining together or a series of linked things.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

I could see Priceline using the concat method when merging arrays of different car types.  Say you are looking at renting a car and have the box checked for Standard but then you also want to look at SUV's or Luxury.  These arrays of the different cars offered could be joined together to show as one list on the page.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I am a bit confused with determining when to use concatenation versus interpolation?? In the examples we did in the exercises it made sense to use either but I'm sure it's not always this way.
